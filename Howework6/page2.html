        <h1>A little story</h1>
        
        <p>Out past Pluto, Mina’s tiny repair ship latched onto a dead satellite that shouldn’t have been there.</p>

        <p>Its hull was warm.</p>

        <p>Her scanner showed no power, no signal—just an impossible heartbeat of heat pulsing through metal that had drifted cold for a century.</p>

        <p>She pressed her glove to the surface. The warmth pressed back.</p>

        <p>A thin seam appeared, like an eyelid opening.</p>

        <p>And in the quiet between stars, something inside the satellite whispered into her suit radio:</p>

        <p>“Finally. A hand.”</p>
